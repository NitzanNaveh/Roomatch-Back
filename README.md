# RooMatch - Server Side API

## Description

This is the backend for RooMatch, an application for finding roommates and apartments. The API provides endpoints for managing users (roommates and property owners), uploading properties, creating matches, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the API, you'll need to make sure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher
* **IntelliJ IDEA** or another preferred Kotlin IDE
* **Ktor**: running the server
* **MongoDB**: you'll need to install and configure MongoDB locally

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ofekamirav/Roomatch-Back
    cd RooMatch-Back
    ```

2. **Run the server:**  
    - Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.  
    - Locate the `Application.kt` file and run it to start the Ktor server.  

3. **Access the API documentation (Swagger):**  
    - Once the server is running, open the following URL in your browser:  
      [http://localhost:8080/openapi](http://localhost:8080/openapi)  
    - This will allow you to send HTTP requests directly via Swagger.
